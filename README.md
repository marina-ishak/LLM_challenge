## ⚠️ Technical Issues Encountered

During the development of this project, we faced several technical challenges that are common in audio classification systems:

### 1. Model Bias and Class Imbalance
**Issue**: The initial model showed severe bias, predicting only class "2" for all inputs despite having balanced training data.

**Root Causes**:
- Improper feature normalization leading to vanishing/exploding gradients
- Insufficient model complexity for the task
- Lack of proper regularization techniques

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added class weights during training to handle any residual imbalance
- Improved feature normalization with per-batch standardization
- Enhanced model architecture with batch normalization layers
- Implemented proper regularization (dropout, L2 regularization)

### 2. Real-time vs Test Performance Gap
**Issue**: The model achieved 98.89% accuracy on the test set but showed poor performance with real-time microphone input.

**Root Causes**:
- Domain shift between clean training data and noisy microphone input
- Different audio characteristics (background noise, microphone quality)
- Preprocessing pipeline differences between training and inference

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Ensemble prediction combining multiple slightly modified inputs
- Enhanced preprocessing pipeline with noise gating and energy-based VAD
- Dynamic feature normalization to match training distribution
- Audio preprocessing identical to training pipeline using the same `featurize` function

### 3. Microphone Sensitivity and Audio Processing
**Issue**: Inconsistent microphone input detection and processing across different hardware setups.

**Challenges**:
- Varying microphone sensitivity across different devices
- Background noise interference
- Audio sample rate and format compatibility

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Configurable energy thresholds with automatic calibration
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with energy-based filtering
- Standardized audio preprocessing (8kHz, mono, float32)
- Audio debugging features saving last recorded samples

### 4. Feature Extraction Consistency
**Issue**: Inconsistencies between training and inference feature extraction leading to poor real-time performance.

**Root Causes**:
- Different preprocessing steps in training vs inference
- Numerical precision differences
- Feature scaling inconsistencies

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified feature extraction pipeline using the exact same functions
- Consistent preprocessing chain (pre-emphasis → VAD → feature extraction → normalization)
- Temporary file-based processing to ensure identical feature computation

### 5. Model Architecture Optimization
**Issue**: Initial lightweight model was too simple for the complexity of the audio classification task.

**Evolution**:
- Started with basic CNN architecture
- Added batch normalization for training stability
- Increased model depth and complexity
- Added regularization to prevent overfitting
- Implemented global average pooling to reduce parameters while maintaining performance

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Audio Recognition Issues

- **Model works well on test set but not on microphone**: This is a common issue due to differences between training data and real-world audio. Try:
  - Using the ensemble prediction in the interactive demo
  - Adding background noise to training data
  - Adjusting microphone sensitivity with `--threshold`

- **Low energy warnings**: Your microphone input may be too quiet. Try:
  - Speaking louder or closer to the microphone
  - Using a better microphone
  - Lowering the threshold with `--threshold 1e-6`

### Installation Issues

- **Audio library errors**: Install required system dependencies:
  - Windows: Install Visual C++ Build Tools
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install libasound-dev portaudio19-dev`

- **Model not found**: Make sure to train the model first with:
  ```bash
  python -m src.train --features mfcc --with-deltas
  ```

### Common Development Issues

- **Model only predicting one class**: This was a major issue we encountered. Check:
  - Feature normalization is working correctly
  - Model architecture has sufficient complexity
  - Training data is balanced and properly preprocessed

- **Poor real-time performance despite good test accuracy**: Use:
  - The ensemble prediction mode in interactive demos
  - Consistent preprocessing between training and inference
  - Audio debugging features to analyze input quality
